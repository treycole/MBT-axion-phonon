1. PT symmetry enforces Kramers degeneracy at each k-point, even with distortion. Quantum Espresso doesn't detect this symmetry and the bands are split at each k-point. In part due to this, the convergence is slow. We need to move origin to halfway between Mn atoms to enforce PT symmetry. New flag should be added in QE calculation.

2. Check if undistorted structure is Z2 odd. Should be, but need to confirm.

3. We need small smearing for intermediate metallic phases.
