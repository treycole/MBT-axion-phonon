This output directory contains the results of the VdW + Hubbard U scf and nscf calculations with U = 4 eV. The Wannier functions show nice localization, and the Wannier interpolated band structure matches the first-principles band structure well. 

- This directory corresponds to job number 124968bc889
- The tmp.tar.gz (local temporary files) in this directory contains the output data for this run. 

### Wannier windows

- Distentanglement: -7-15 eV
- Frozen: 2.5-11 eV

### Trial wavefunctions
Number of bands from -7-15 eV = 75 (without SOC)
Number of bands from 2.5-11 eV ~ 46 (without SOC)

- Mn1 d: 5 (l orbs) x 1 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 10
- Mn2 d: 5 (l orbs) x 1 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 10
- Bi p: 3 (l orbs) x 4 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 24
- Te p: 3 (l orbs) x 8 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 48
Total number of trial states = 92 (/2 = 46)

Remaining states:
- Mn1 s2: 1 (l orbs) x 1 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 2
- Mn2 s2: 1 (l orbs) x 1 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 2
- Bi s: 1 (l orbs) x 4 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 8
- Te s: 1 (l orbs) x 8 (atoms) x 2 (spins) = 16
